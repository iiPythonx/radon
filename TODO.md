- [ ] Ensure a client (public key) cannot connect multiple times
- [ ] Implement a Python module to connect to a local Radon node
- [ ] Implement a socket for a normal node (for use by the Python client)
- [ ] Clean up client/key handling logic

- [ ] Attempt to consolidate both incoming and outgoing websockets into one
      main data handling processing function type thing. There should only be
      one match case for all the input/output of Radon.
